# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a machine learning-based cybersecurity solution designed to detect and prevent malicious activities in network traffic. This system analyzes network packets, identifies anomalies, and classifies potential threats such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and malware infections. This system builds an intelligent, real-time intrusion detection system that can differentiate between normal and malicious traffic, reducing cybersecurity risks for organizations.
