# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)  

A **machine learning-based cybersecurity solution** designed to detect and prevent malicious activities in network traffic.  
This system analyzes network packets, identifies anomalies, and classifies potential threats such as:  
- 🚨 Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks  
- 🔑 Unauthorized access attempts  
- 🦠 Malware infections  

The goal is to build an **intelligent, real-time intrusion detection system** that can differentiate between normal and malicious traffic, reducing cybersecurity risks for organizations.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Traditional security tools often fail to detect sophisticated attacks.  
This project leverages **machine learning** to improve intrusion detection by:  
- Capturing and preprocessing network traffic data.  
- Extracting meaningful features from packet-level data.  
- Training ML models to classify normal vs. malicious traffic.  
- Providing real-time threat alerts for proactive defense.

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Network traffic datasets (e.g., KDD, NSL-KDD, CICIDS).  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extract packet-level and flow-level features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand patterns of attacks and anomalies.  
4. **Model Training** – ML models like Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, and Deep Learning.  
5. **Evaluation Metrics** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
6. **Real-Time Detection** – Simulated network traffic for live testing.
